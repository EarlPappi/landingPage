# landingPage

## Voila, my hidden space
Welcome to my hidden space, except its not a hidden space! I started my frontend design journey and I will be putting up my progress on here, although I have created a little lot of repositories which I couldn't get to work. I will be putting most of the landing page I create in this space

# NOTE: All designs are SICK
Of course not down with COVID type of sick! I created everything with the basic HTML and CSS I've learnt. Most pages are designs I picked off dribble and recreated with HTML and CSS

- 1st entry: landing_page_Alan ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/landing_page_Alan/index_flex.html (not really mobile responsive, 7/10 in my impressed opinion)
- 2nd entry: webpage_bexon ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/webpage_bexon/index.html (haha, quite a little lot of work for my beginner's self but I really "flex" tha helll outta CSS, pun intended. Also, my first time working with fontawesome locally, 6.7/10 in my impressed opinion! Learnt a whole lot from this project)
- 3rd entry: webpage_estate ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/webpage_estate/index.html (time record design, haha! Tidied the css a little bit more, 8.2/10 in my impressed opinion, 0.743 for the speed)
- 4th entry: webpage_wilding ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/webpage_wildling/index.html (more improved css codes, class and element selectors getting more tidies, well, still not responsive design, overall 8/10 in my impressed opinion, great control and improved codes)
- ### Well well well, my next entry will be my first shot at writing mobile responsive designs
- 5th entry: website_exercise ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//website_exercise/home.html (Hahaha, of course, back with a banger for the new year, I made a proper simple website with all the pages connected, enjoy structuring the designs and making also first attempt at embeding google map. Oops, not mobile responsive, 7.6/10 in my impressed opinion. I made little effort to attain uniformity of  spacing, font size and color)
- 6th entry: landing_res ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/landing_res/index.html (sixth time they say, is the charm! here is my first shot at responsive design using media query! Made at record time even though its my first time using google font as well! 8.052/10 in my impressed opinion. Little effort was made to the text display and styling. All effort was placed on the responsiveness)
- 7th entry: landing_kulijawa ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/landing_kulijawa/index.html (seven is a sign of perfection in the kanchuta kingdom, unfortunately the figure was/is never responsive and so is this design. Sleek, cleaner codes, 8.021123/10 in my impressed opinion)
- 8th entry: web_fiber ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//web_fiber/index.html (I did a thing with this design haha, the 8th time is definitely the charm! A fully responsive design with a little cherry with the hamburger function (urrhhmmm, I used two lines of JS, maybe 8 lines tho to make the hamburger onClick work! 8.67/ 10 in my impressed opinion). PS: Expect a whole lot of updates to this page yunno. The chef is still cooking.. UPDATE: I worked a little bit more on the layout then fix a little more display, added another responsive page to it <sign in> now work!)
- 9th entry: chess ==> [Chess Board](https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//chess/index.html) (not really an entry but I will count it as one. A grid layout i designed in blitz mode. 8.89 in my impressed opinion. Fast thinking and everything is in place within 380 seconds!)
  
  ## The 10th entry is gonna be the BOMB!
