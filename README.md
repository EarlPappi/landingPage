# landingPage

## Voila, my hidden space
Welcome to my hidden space, except its not a hidden space! I started my frontend design journey and I will puttin up my progress on here, although I have creted a little lot of repositories which I couldn't get to work. I will be putting most of the landing page I create in this space

# NOTE: All designs are SICK
Of course not down with COVID type of sick! I created everything with the basic HTML and CSS I've learnt. Most pages are designs i picked of dribble and recreated with HTML and CSS
