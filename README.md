# landingPage

## Voila, my hidden space
Welcome to my hidden space, except its not a hidden space! I started my frontend design journey and I will be putting up my progress on here, although I have created a little lot of repositories which I couldn't get to work. I will be putting most of the landing page I create in this space

# NOTE: All designs are SICK
Of course not down with COVID type of sick! I created everything with the basic HTML and CSS I've learnt. Most pages are designs I picked off dribble and recreated with HTML and CSS

- 1st entry: landing_page_Alan ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/landing_page_Alan/index_flex.html (not really mobile responsive, 7/10 in my impressed opinion)
- 2nd entry: webpage_bexon ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage/webpage_bexon/index.html (haha, quite a little lot of work for my beginner's self but I really "flex" tha helll outta CSS, pun intended. Also, my first time working with fontawesome locally, 6.7/10 in my impressed opinion! Learnt a whole lot from this project)
- 3rd entry: webpage_estate ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//webpage_estate/index.html (time record design, haha! Tidied the css a little bit more, 8.2/10 in my impressed opinion, 0.743 for the speed)
- 4th entry: webpage_wilding ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//webpage_wildling/index.html (more improved css codes, class and element selectors getting more tidies, well, still not responsive design, overall 8/10 in my impressed opinion, great control and improved codes)
- ### Well well well, my next entry will be my first shot at writing mobile responsive designs
- 5th entry: website_exercise ==> https://earlpappi.github.io/landingPage//website_exercise/home.html (Hahaha, of course, back with a banger for the new year, I made a proper simple website with all the pages connected. )
