                <h3 class="small-span">HEAVY METAL CODING</h3>

                <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks
                    in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rythm of learning - both of code and drum
                    beats! You'll learn the basics of JavaScript and CSS, plus the beginner's heavy metal drum
                    patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration
                    than beating seven shades of hell out of a drum kit.
